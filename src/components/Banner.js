                            Hello and welcome! I'm a recent graduate of the University of Southern California, where I earned a combined degree in Computer Science and Business Administration with a minor in Artificial Intelligence Applications. I'm passionate about solving challenging problems and creating impactful solutions, and I built this portfolio to help shed some insights on the person behind the code, share my journey, and showcase my work and technical skills. I also simply love to build new things!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I didn't begin my academic journey in Computer Science. My first few years in college I was solely a Business major, where I gained valuable insights into strategy, leadership, communication, teamwork, and organizational dynamics. However, I always felt a pull towards something more tangible and technical, where I could directly create solutions and see my personal impact. In my Junior year, I began exploring coding and fell in love with itâ€”I felt like I unlocked the ability to bring ideas to life, solve meaningful problems, and much more.
